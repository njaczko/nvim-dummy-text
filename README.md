# Dummy Text

This plugin inserts the names of mountains in Vermont, U.S.A. for use as dummy
text. The names have been stripped of words like `Mountain`, `Mount`, and
`Peak`. Names with multiple words have been reduced to a singel word with
concatenation.

Most of the names were scraped from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mountains_of_Vermont),
but I've added some of my other favorites.

## Usage

TODO.

## Installation

Place this in your `.vimrc`:
